# indentation is very important in python
# indentation is used to define a block of code
# indentation is used to define the scope of the code
# indentation is used to define the flow of the code
# indentation is used to make the code more readable
# indentation is used to make the code more organized
# indentation is used to make the code more structured

# example of indentation
# if 5 > 2:
#     print("Five is greater than two")
#     print("Hello World")
#     print("Welcome to Python")
#     print("Python is fun")
#     print("Python is easy")
#     print("Python is powerful")
#     print("Python is versatile")

# example of indentation
# if 5 > 2:
#     print("Five is greater than two")
#     print("Hello World")

# without indentation
# if 5 > 2:
# print("Five is greater than two")
# print("Hello World")


# above code will give an error because indentation is missing
